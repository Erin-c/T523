                      <p>The existing data showed that <strong>14 of the 17 schools</strong> indicated that their <strong>reason for implementing a personalized learning solution was to better serve students</strong>, while <strong>only 2 schools explicitly wrote up a pilot that directly addressed just their student body</strong> and 6 schools talked addressed students as a part of their pilot. 11 schools did not mention students at all in their actual solution or implementation plans. One possible interpretation of this is that these programs are new to personalized learning and are addressing change from a professional development standpoint. This could indicate the exposure a school has had to personalized learning, since only 3 schools explicitly indicated that they had participated in personalized learning professional development.</p>

                      <p>Our stakeholder indicated that equity and accessibility were important goals of their program. Upon analyzing the data, <strong>only 4 schools used terms like equity, equality, access, and accessibility more than 4 times in their pilot implementation reports</strong>, one interpretation is that most schools were focused more on issues that were unique to their schools, which did not necessarily overlap with issues that the MISL program emphasized. Another interpretation of this could be that participants were more focused at the problems at hand that could be solved in the short term, instead of tackling long term problems like equity and accessibility.</p>

                      <p>This instrument also yielded participants’ understanding of personalized learning. We coded for words and themes around student choice, student voice, student autonomy, etc. <strong>11 schools used these words and themes more than 3 times in their report</strong>. One interpretation of this is that these are the common ways people talk about personalized learning and implementing such solutions. Schools seemed to have a good grasp of actual use of these terms and themes.</p>
